# BetterManual

This app is intended to ease shooting in manual and aperture priority mode with (legacy) prime lenses on the A5100 camera. It uses the [OpenMemories Framework](https://github.com/ma1co/OpenMemories-Framework).
**While the app may work on other cameras, it was written specifically for use with the A5100.**
